I think that the article made a really good argument for the merits of wire framing. I've been working on a project recently that's had someone dedicated to ux design in figma, which has been really helpful. But I think after reading this article I've realized that something that in-depth is not always necessary. A simple sketched wireframe just to lay out and organize a design is still incredibly helpful, even if there is no styling or concrete spacing. The bit on collaboration makes a lot of sense too. Rough designs aren't going to be nitpicked as much, so the feedback matters more.
